### ðŸ”µ What is this?

An extension for Firefox that gives users a safe degree of control over CORS requests, with the specific goal of preventing the browser from leaking unnecessary information.

### ðŸ”µ What is CORS?

CORS stands for *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing*. In short, it is a mechanism used for bypassing the same-origin policy safely.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) â–ª [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) â–ª [W3C](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-cors-for-developers/)

### ðŸ”µ What is the same-origin policy?

It is a standard that has been widely adopted for many years. From the client's perspective, it denies access to resources when these are requested by other resources that were fetched from a different location. Such requests are known as cross-origin requests. 

The same-origin policy is an effective security measure against both [XSS][XSS] and [XSRF][XSRF].

### ðŸ”µ How does CORS work?

Every time the browser makes a cross-origin request, it adds an `Origin` HTTP header to it, which tells the server the location of the resource that triggered the request. After the server parses that header, it decides whether to allow or deny access to its resource from that location. If access is allowed, the sever adds an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the response, indicating so. The most common values are:

1. `<origin>`: this is the `scheme`+`hostname`+`port` (`https://www.example.org:8080`) of the resource that is allowed access. 
2. `*`: this means the resource is *public*. It can be accessed from anywhere as long as the request does not include credentials.
3. `null`: in practice, this denies access to the resource, but this way is discouraged. The recommended way is to not include an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header at all.
4. no header: access is denied.

When the client reads the response headers, the request succeeds or fails based on the presence or absence of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (and its value). If the request did not include credentials, it only succeeds if the value of that header corresponds to either #1 or #2 (as listed above). If it *did* include credentials, the value must correspond to #1.

### ðŸ”µ How does this extension work?

It has two main modes of operation: aggressive and relaxed.

- The aggressive mode quite simply alters all `GET` requests that include an `Origin` header. This has the potential to break many websites, which is why the extension also allows more fine-grained control via other options like a whitelist and exclusions.
- The relaxed mode uses heuristics to guess which `GET` requests can include credentials, and excludes those automatically. This is the default mode because it is the easiest way to prevent breakage, but since it relies on heuristics, it is by no means perfect. I recommend you to try out the aggressive mode and whitelist sites when needed instead.

When this extension decides to alter a request (after passing it through all the filters), that request is modified as follows:
1. The `Origin` header is removed from it.
2. Since there is no `Origin` header, the server's response most likely does not include an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header either, which would normally cause it to fail. To prevent that, this extension injects an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header into that specific response.

### ðŸ”µ How exactly does the relaxed mode work?

In relaxed mode, a request is excluded automatically when it fulfills any of the following conditions:
- it includes cookies.
- it includes an `Authorization` header.
- it includes the `username`, `password`, `query` or `hash` portions of the URL. `scheme://username:password@hostname:port/path/?query#hash`

### ðŸ”µ What about preflight requests?

Preflight requests use the `OPTIONS` method instead of the `GET` method.

Up to version `1.2.1`, the extension was outright ignoring all non-`GET` requests, including those. However, Since `1.3.0` the extension also alters preflight requests, but **only when it knows that the actual request(s) will use the `GET` method**. It does this by reading the `Access-Control-Request-Method` header in the preflight request. If it is found and the value is `GET`, the preflight request itself is altered too, otherwise it is ignored just like before `1.3.0`.

### ðŸ”µ Is this extension *safe*?

Yes. At worst it will break website functionality, but there are various built-in ways to circumvent that.

### ðŸ”µ Why P.O.O.P.?

Because I'm but a lowly hacker-wannabe and I don't want to raise anyone's expectations if I can avoid it. Plus, it was easy to come up with, and it is just as easy to remember.

### ðŸ”µ Dat icon is tacky AF

![Deal with it.][DWI]

Just pretend it's ice cream or something.

### ðŸ”µ Privacy
This extension is meant to *protect* your privacy, not *just* respect it. 

Since you're on Firefox and you seem to care about your privacy, I might as well recommend you to take a good look at [this project](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js), which is where this extension was first conceived.

### ðŸ”µ Acknowledgments
- Big thanks to [crssi](https://github.com/crssi) for [bringing attention][issue] to this previously overlooked tracking vector, for all the help testing, and for all the feature suggestions and valuable feedback. If not for him, the extension would still be the half-assed solution I first came up with, because I'm quite the lazy bum.
